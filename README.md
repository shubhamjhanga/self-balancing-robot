# self-balancing-robot
A two-wheeled self-balancing robot powered by an MPU6050 IMU and a PID control system. It maintains balance autonomously by processing real-time sensor feedback to control the motors.
## Features
Integration of MPU6050 gyroscope and accelerometer

PID-based control system for stable balancing

Real-time feedback and correction using DC motors and motor drivers

Built using Arduino C++ and embedded programming techniques

## Technologies Used

Arduino C++

Embedded Systems

PID Control Theory

Sensor Fusion (Gyro + Accelerometer)
